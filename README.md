## Overview

**ClawX** bridges the gap between powerful AI agents and everyday users. Built on top of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/OpenClaw), it transforms command-line AI orchestration into an accessible, beautiful desktop experience—no terminal required.

Whether you're automating workflows, managing AI-powered channels, or scheduling intelligent tasks, ClawX provides the interface you need to harness AI agents effectively.

ClawX comes pre-configured with best-practice model providers and natively supports Windows as well as multi-language settings. Of course, you can also fine-tune advanced configurations via **Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode**.

## Why ClawX

Building AI agents shouldn't require mastering the command line. ClawX was designed with a simple philosophy: **powerful technology deserves an interface that respects your time.**

| Challenge | ClawX Solution |
|-----------|----------------|
| Complex CLI setup | One-click installation with guided setup wizard |
| Configuration files | Visual settings with real-time validation |
| Process management | Automatic gateway lifecycle management |
| Multiple AI providers | Unified provider configuration panel |
| Skill/plugin installation | Built-in skill marketplace and management |

### OpenClaw Inside

ClawX is built directly upon the official **OpenClaw** core. Instead of requiring a separate installation, we embed the runtime within the application to provide a seamless "battery-included" experience.

We are committed to maintaining strict alignment with the upstream OpenClaw project, ensuring that you always have access to the latest capabilities, stability improvements, and ecosystem compatibility provided by the official releases.

---

## Features

### 🎯 Zero Configuration Barrier
Complete the entire setup—from installation to your first AI interaction—through an intuitive graphical interface. No terminal commands, no YAML files, no environment variable hunting.

### 💬 Intelligent Chat Interface
Communicate with AI agents through a modern chat experience. Support for multiple conversation contexts, message history, rich content rendering with Markdown, and direct `@agent` routing in the main composer for multi-agent setups.
When you target another agent with `@agent`, ClawX switches into that agent's own conversation context directly instead of relaying through the default agent. Agent workspaces stay separate by default, and stronger isolation depends on OpenClaw sandbox settings.
Each agent can also override its own `provider/model` runtime setting; agents without overrides continue inheriting the global default model.

### 📡 Multi-Channel Management
Configure and monitor multiple AI channels simultaneously. Each channel operates independently, allowing you to run specialized agents for different tasks.
Each channel now supports multiple accounts, per-account agent binding, and switching the channel default account directly from the Channels page.
ClawX now also bundles Tencent's official personal WeChat channel plugin, so you can link WeChat directly from the Channels page with an in-app QR flow.

### ⏰ Cron-Based Automation
Schedule AI tasks to run automatically. Define triggers, set intervals, and let your AI agents work around the clock without manual intervention.
The Cron page now lets you configure external delivery directly in the task form with separate sender-account and recipient-target selectors. For supported channels, recipient targets are discovered automatically from channel directories or known session history, so you no longer need to edit `jobs.json` by hand.
Known limitation: WeChat is intentionally excluded from supported cron delivery channels for now. The current `openclaw-weixin` plugin requires a live conversation `contextToken` for outbound sends, so cron-style proactive delivery is not supported by the plugin itself.

### 🧩 Extensible Skill System
Extend your AI agents with pre-built skills. Browse, install, and manage skills through the integrated skill panel—no package managers required.
ClawX also pre-bundles full document-processing skills (`pdf`, `xlsx`, `docx`, `pptx`), deploys them automatically to the managed skills directory (default `~/.openclaw/skills`) on startup, and enables them by default on first install. Additional bundled skills (`find-skills`, `self-improving-agent`, `tavily-search`, `brave-web-search`) are also enabled by default; if required API keys are missing, OpenClaw will surface configuration errors in runtime.  
The Skills page can display skills discovered from multiple OpenClaw sources (managed dir, workspace, and extra skill dirs), and now shows each skill's actual location so you can open the real folder directly.

Environment variables for bundled search skills:
- `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` for `brave-web-search`
- `TAVILY_API_KEY` for `tavily-search` (OAuth may also be supported by upstream skill runtime)
- `find-skills` and `self-improving-agent` do not require API keys

### 🔐 Secure Provider Integration
Connect to multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and more) with credentials stored securely in your system's native keychain. OpenAI supports both API key and browser OAuth (Codex subscription) sign-in.
For **Custom** providers used with OpenAI-compatible gateways, you can set a custom `User-Agent` in **Settings → AI Providers → Edit Provider** for compatibility-sensitive endpoints.
When a compatible gateway rejects `/models` for non-auth reasons, ClawX automatically falls back to a lightweight `/chat/completions` or `/responses` probe during API key validation.

### 🌙 Adaptive Theming
Light mode, dark mode, or system-synchronized themes. ClawX adapts to your preferences automatically.

### 🚀 Startup Launch Control
In **Settings → General**, you can enable **Launch at system startup** so ClawX starts automatically after login.

---

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: macOS 11+, Windows 10+, or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 1GB available disk space

### Installation

#### Pre-built Releases (Recommended)

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/ValueCell-ai/ClawX/releases) page.

#### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ValueCell-ai/ClawX.git
cd ClawX

# Initialize the project
pnpm run init

# Start in development mode
pnpm dev
```
### First Launch

When you launch ClawX for the first time, the **Setup Wizard** will guide you through:

1. **Language & Region** – Configure your preferred locale
2. **AI Provider** – Setup is locked to MiloClaw during onboarding; you can add other providers later in **Settings → AI Providers**
3. **Skill Bundles** – Select pre-configured skills for common use cases
4. **Verification** – Test your configuration before entering the main interface

The wizard preselects your system language when it is supported, and falls back to English otherwise.

> Note for Moonshot (Kimi): ClawX keeps Kimi web search enabled by default.  
> When Moonshot is configured, ClawX also syncs Kimi web search to the China endpoint (`https://api.moonshot.cn/v1`) in OpenClaw config.

### Proxy Settings

ClawX includes built-in proxy settings for environments where Electron, the OpenClaw Gateway, or channels such as Telegram need to reach the internet through a local proxy client.

Open **Settings → Gateway → Proxy** and configure:

- **Proxy Server**: the default proxy for all requests
- **Bypass Rules**: hosts that should connect directly, separated by semicolons, commas, or new lines
- In **Developer Mode**, you can optionally override:
  - **HTTP Proxy**
  - **HTTPS Proxy**
  - **ALL_PROXY / SOCKS**

Recommended local examples:

```text
Proxy Server: http://127.0.0.1:7890
```
Notes:

- A bare `host:port` value is treated as HTTP.
- If advanced proxy fields are left empty, ClawX falls back to `Proxy Server`.
- Saving proxy settings reapplies Electron networking immediately and restarts the Gateway automatically.
- ClawX also syncs the proxy to OpenClaw's Telegram channel config when Telegram is enabled.
- Gateway restarts preserve an existing Telegram channel proxy if ClawX proxy is currently disabled.
- To explicitly clear Telegram channel proxy from OpenClaw config, save proxy settings with proxy disabled.
- In **Settings → Advanced → Developer**, you can run **OpenClaw Doctor** to execute `openclaw doctor --json` and inspect the diagnostic output without leaving the app.
- On packaged Windows builds, the bundled `openclaw` CLI/TUI runs via the shipped `node.exe` entrypoint to keep terminal input behavior stable.

## Architecture

ClawX employs a **dual-process architecture** with a unified host API layer. The renderer talks to a single client abstraction, while Electron Main owns protocol selection and process lifecycle:

```
### Design Principles

- **Process Isolation**: The AI runtime operates in a separate process, ensuring UI responsiveness even during heavy computation
- **Single Entry for Frontend Calls**: Renderer requests go through host-api/api-client; protocol details are hidden behind a stable interface
- **Main-Process Transport Ownership**: Electron Main controls WS/HTTP usage and fallback to IPC for reliability
- **Graceful Recovery**: Built-in reconnect, timeout, and backoff logic handles transient failures automatically
- **Secure Storage**: API keys and sensitive data leverage the operating system's native secure storage mechanisms
- **CORS-Safe by Design**: Local HTTP access is proxied by Main, preventing renderer-side CORS issues

### Process Model & Gateway Troubleshooting

- ClawX is an Electron app, so **one app instance normally appears as multiple OS processes** (main/renderer/zygote/utility). This is expected.
- Single-instance protection uses Electron's lock plus a local process-file lock fallback, preventing duplicate app launch in environments where desktop IPC/session bus is unstable.
- During rolling upgrades, mixed old/new app versions can still have asymmetric protection behavior. For best reliability, upgrade all desktop clients to the same version.
- The OpenClaw Gateway listener should still be **single-owner**: only one process should listen on `127.0.0.1:18789`.
- To verify the active listener:
  - macOS/Linux: `lsof -nP -iTCP:18789 -sTCP:LISTEN`
  - Windows (PowerShell): `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 18789 -State Listen`
- Clicking the window close button (`X`) hides ClawX to tray; it does **not** fully quit the app. Use tray menu **Quit ClawX** for complete shutdown.

### Available Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm run init             # Install dependencies + download uv
pnpm dev                  # Start with hot reload (auto-prepares bundled skills if missing)

# Quality
pnpm lint                 # Run ESLint
pnpm typecheck            # TypeScript validation

# Testing
pnpm test                 # Run unit tests
pnpm run test:e2e         # Run Electron E2E smoke tests with Playwright
pnpm run test:e2e:headed  # Run Electron E2E tests with a visible window
pnpm run comms:replay     # Compute communication replay metrics
pnpm run comms:baseline   # Refresh communication baseline snapshot
pnpm run comms:compare    # Compare replay metrics against baseline thresholds

# Build & Package
pnpm run build:vite       # Build frontend only
pnpm build                # Full production build (with packaging assets)
pnpm package              # Package for current platform (includes bundled preinstalled skills)
pnpm package:mac          # Package for macOS
pnpm package:win          # Package for Windows
pnpm package:linux        # Package for Linux
```

On headless Linux, run Electron tests under a display server such as `xvfb-run -a pnpm run test:e2e`.

### Communication Regression Checks

When a PR changes communication paths (gateway events, chat runtime send/receive flow, channel delivery, or transport fallback), run:

```bash
pnpm run comms:replay
pnpm run comms:compare
```

`comms-regression` in CI enforces required scenarios and threshold checks.

### Electron E2E Tests

The Playwright Electron suite launches the packaged renderer and main process
from `dist/` and `dist-electron/`, so it does not require manually running
`pnpm dev` first.

`pnpm run test:e2e` automatically:

- builds the renderer and Electron bundles with `pnpm run build:vite`
- starts Electron in an isolated E2E mode with a temporary `HOME`
- uses a temporary ClawX `userData` directory
- skips heavy startup side effects such as gateway auto-start, bundled skill
  installation, tray creation, and CLI auto-install

The first two baseline specs cover:

- first-launch setup wizard visibility on a fresh profile
- skipping setup and navigating to the Models page inside the Electron app

Add future Electron flows under `tests/e2e/` and reuse the shared fixture in
`tests/e2e/fixtures/electron.ts`.
